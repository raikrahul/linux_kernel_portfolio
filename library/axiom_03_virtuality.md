# Axiom 03: The Lie of Addressing

**Subject**: Virtual Memory, Pointers, and The MMU
**Derived From**: `malloc_pagefault`

---

## 1. The Pointer Axiom
*   **Statement**: Every address generated by a CPU instruction is Virtual.
*   **Implication**: Software never touches RAM directly. Software requests a virtual address; Hardware (MMU) grants a physical location.

## 2. Derivation: The Lazy Contract

### The Negotiation
1.  **Request**: User asks for 1GB (`malloc`).
2.  **Promise**: Kernel says "Yes" (updates VMA).
3.  **Reality**: Kernel gives **Zero** physical bytes.

### The Breach
1.  **Action**: User writes to the promised address.
2.  **Detection**: MMU sees empty Page Table Entry. Raises `#PF` (Page Fault).
3.  **Resolution**: Kernel pauses execution, finds a physical page, maps it, and resumes.

## 3. The Consequence
*   **Axiom**: Only Access creates Reality.
*   **Proof**: A system with 16GB RAM can `malloc` 100GB of memory, as long as it doesn't touch it all at once.
